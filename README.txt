Project Title: Int Test

Description: This program creates an array that functions like a ArrayList.

Languages used: Java

I created this program to practice using arrays. This program involves 2 files:
InList.java and TestIntList.java. Please find information about each file below:

IntList.java- this file creates an array that is able to be manipulated like and
ArrayList. Traditionally, arrays are fixed in size, so they are not able to expand.
This array is able to expand.

TestIntList.java- this file includes a list of a series of tests to test the
methods in IntList.java.

To run this project, compile the TestIntList.java file and run it in the
terminal.
